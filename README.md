A simple utility that converts a PDF file into an HTML file using a remote custom made Python Flask server endpoint.

Once converted, the resulting HTML file (or the chunks of 10 pages of the HTML file) will be opened in new browser tabs.

You can also download the HTML file (or its chunks of 10 pages).
